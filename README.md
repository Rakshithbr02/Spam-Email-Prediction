# Spam Email Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting whether an email is spam or not. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing examples of both spam and non-spam (ham) emails. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the goal is to accurately classify incoming emails as either spam or non-spam.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. Each email is represented as a text document, and the dataset includes features such as email content, sender information, and metadata. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and prepare it for training the machine learning model.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw email data is preprocessed to clean and tokenize the text, remove stop words, and perform other text normalization techniques.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from the preprocessed text using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to represent each email as a numerical vector.
3. **Model Training**: Various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines are trained on the labeled dataset to learn patterns and relationships between features and email labels.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their performance in predicting spam emails.
5. **Deployment**: Once a satisfactory model is selected, it can be deployed to classify incoming emails in real-time.
